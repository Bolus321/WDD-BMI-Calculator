		Body Mass Index (BMI) quantifies the combined weight of the muscle, fat, and bone mass in an individual. BMI is a screening tool that can let you know if you may be at risk for weight-related health problems. 
		<br>
		<br>
		
		For adults, BMI is categorized into underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and obesity based on their respective BMI value. The simplicity of the body mass index calculation is one of its advantages. This BMI calculator is for adults 20 and older and it measures BMI as: kg per square meter (kg/m2). 
		<br>
		<br>
		
		For children & teens from two years of age to nineteen years, please utilize this <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bmi/child-teen-calculator/index.html" target="_blank">BMI Calculator for Children and Teens.</a>
		The importance and usefulness of the index and hence any Body Mass Index calculator is in its curvilinear relationship to all-cause mortality. The bigger your calculated BMI is, the higher the risk of mortality compared to those with a healthy BMI.
